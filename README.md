5. **Peep the info:**

- **Currently installed** will check the **_version.txt_** file for the GitHub release tag that you have in your game. If you do not have a version.txt in your root game directory, it will download the latest update and create a version.txt for you. If you know what version you're on, just create your own version.txt and put the GitHub release tag in there.
